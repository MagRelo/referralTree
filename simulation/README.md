# Referral Reward System Economic Simulator

A Mesa-based agent simulation that models the **economic incentives** and **viral growth dynamics** of multi-level referral reward systems. Perfect for crypto-social apps, DeFi protocols, and any platform using referral incentives.

## 🎯 What This Models

**Economic Behavior**: Users earn and distribute rewards through referral chains
- **Purchase Events**: Random user activities that trigger reward distributions
- **Chain Rewards**: Rewards flow upward through referral trees using exponential/linear decay
- **Incentive Effects**: Economic motivations influence referral behavior
- **Cost Analysis**: Calculate total reward costs vs. user acquisition value

**Network Dynamics**: Viral growth patterns with realistic user behavior
- **Referral Networks**: Multi-level trees with configurable depth limits
- **Churn Modeling**: Users become inactive over time
- **Engagement Patterns**: Time-based delays and probability distributions

## 📊 Parameters & Assumptions Assessment

| | Referral Probability | 15% daily | 15% of engaged users refer daily | Match your observed referral rate | `referral_probability` |
| | Churn Rate | 1% daily | ~70% retention over 3 months | Use your actual churn data | `churn_probability` |
| **User Behavior** | Referral Delay | 5 days | Time to understand/learn product | Adjust for your onboarding time | `min_referral_delay` |
| | Active User Definition | Not churned | Users still engaged | Customize based on your metrics | Agent `active` attribute |
| | Referral Limits | 3 per step | Prevent unrealistic growth | Set based on platform limits | `max_referrals_per_step` |
| **Economic Events** | Purchase Probability | 2% daily | 2% of users trigger rewards daily | Match your transaction rate | `event_probability` in code |
| | Purchase Amount | Log-normal μ=$7.39 | Realistic transaction distribution | Use your average order value | Distribution parameters |
| | Reward Decay Type | Exponential | Front-load rewards to early users | Choose based on incentive goals | `reward_decay_type` |
| | Decay Factor | 70% per level | 70% retention per referral level | Balance generosity vs. cost | `reward_decay_factor` |
| | Original User Share | 80% | Trigger user gets 80% of rewards | Adjust based on economics | `original_user_percentage` |
| | Minimum Reward | $0.05 | Smallest reward payment | Set transaction fee minimum | `min_reward` |
| **Network Structure** | Max Users | 1,000 | Simulation capacity limit | Scale based on expected growth | `max_users` |
| | Max Depth | 50 levels | Prevent infinite chains | Set based on your reward limits | Chain traversal limit |
| | Referral Clustering | Random | No geographic/social clustering | Add clustering if needed | Network generation logic |
| **Time Dynamics** | Step Duration | 1 day | Each simulation step = 1 day | Match your analysis timeframe | Interpretation of results |
| | Simulation Length | 50 days | Default run duration | Adjust for your planning horizon | Function parameters |

## 🎯 Use Case Assessment

**✅ Good Fit For:**
- Crypto/Social apps with referral incentives
- DeFi protocols with reward distributions
- Any platform with multi-level referral mechanics
- Projects optimizing reward costs vs. user growth

**❓ Questions to Ask:**
- Is your referral rate >5% monthly? (Lower rates may need conservative scenarios)
- Do users make purchases/transactions regularly? (Economic events drive rewards)
- Are rewards in fiat/crypto tokens? (Simulation assumes dollar values)
- Is network depth >3 levels economically viable? (Current decay creates shallow trees)

**🔧 Customization Path:**
1. **Behavioral Match**: Adjust referral/churn probabilities to match your data
2. **Economic Calibration**: Set reward amounts and decay to match your incentives
3. **Scale Adjustment**: Change user limits and timeframes for your scope
4. **Network Structure**: Add clustering or constraints specific to your platform

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Prerequisites**: Python virtual environment already set up with dependencies.

```bash
cd simulation
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# Test the simulation
python test_simulation.py

# Run economic analysis
python economic_analysis.py moderate

# Compare scenarios
python scenario_test.py compare
```

## 📈 Key Results Summary

| Scenario | Viral Coefficient | Users | Reward Cost/User | Best For |
|----------|------------------|-------|------------------|----------|
| **Conservative** | 1.031 | ~50 | $2.50 | Established communities |
| **Moderate** | 1.096 | ~1,000 | $5.50 | New crypto-social apps |
| **Aggressive** | 1.112 | ~2,000 | $8.50 | High-incentive campaigns |

**Economic Insights**:
- Exponential decay creates high inequality (Gini: 0.82)
- Level 0 users earn 4x more than Level 1 users
- 80% of rewards go to original purchasers
- Viral growth requires 10-15% daily referral probability

## 🔧 Customization Guide

**To Match Your Use Case:**

1. **Update Behavioral Parameters**: Modify referral/churn rates in scenario definitions
2. **Adjust Economic Parameters**: Change reward amounts and decay in model initialization
3. **Customize Events**: Modify purchase probability and amounts in `_generate_reward_events()`
4. **Add Network Effects**: Implement clustering or geographic constraints in agent behavior

**Example Customization**:
```python
# For a high-churn mobile app
model = ReferralModel(
    referral_probability=0.08,    # Lower engagement
    churn_probability=0.015,      # Higher churn
    reward_decay_factor=6000,     # More aggressive decay
    original_user_percentage=7500  # More rewards to purchasers
)
```
